### Retrospectives
## mad
The plan of UX and week plan should be more detailed
## sad
Time to study instead of constantly delaying the plan.
Our team needs to deal with the current problems more efficiently.
The back-end should speed up the progress and be connected with the toxic comment detection of the data as soon as possible. 


## glad
The current interface is very beautiful, and the research content is meaningful
