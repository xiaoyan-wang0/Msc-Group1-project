428,"Lindsey Stirling LIVE, Home for the Holidays","Stirling wanted to go bigger for Christmas. She’s done a holiday tour for the past three years, and it didn’t feel right to break that tradition — especially during a year in need of cheer. An in-person tour was off the table, but she also wasn’t interested in doing a livestream performance — “there’s no way you can really capture a live show and make it feel live and vibrant on the screen,” she said.  Instead, the violinist decided to create somewhat of an extended, glorified music video with elaborate set pieces and costumes — elements that wouldn’t work in a live show because they’d take too long to remove or load on and off a truck each night. Doing this show on a budget, Stirling clocked 16-hour days for two months as creative director, designing the sets, sourcing the costumes and helping develop the choreography (including a performance where she hangs by her hair).","[10751, 10402]",775677
429,For Don Carlos,"Pour Don Carlos was the biggest production by Société des Films Musidora (est. December 10, 1919). Based on a novel by Pierre Benoît, Musidora’s first creatively autonomous work is set during the conflict between Carlists and Bourbons in late 19th century Spain. Benoît insisted that Jacques Lasseyne, a Spanish grandee who put money into the production, should co-direct. The film was shot in 1920, in the Spanish Basque Country. It represents a turning point in Musidora’s career, sparking her passionate love affair with a country and a culture that welcomed her as a great star. Above all, though, she encountered Antonio Cañero, a bullfighter who acted as her technical adviser on the film. Because of him, she did all she could to ensure that her succeeding productions, until 1926, were shot in Spain. Pour Don Carlos was released in Paris and in Madrid in December 1921, in a shortened version because its original, three-hour length made it impossible to release in the market of the time.",[18],607291

Earlier phases of development transformed the Port Lands into a human-built space for economic activity without regard for negative impacts on the existing environment. Evidence of this disregard persists in new so-called ""revitalization"" plans in which the water, land and inhabitants are conceived not as a living ecosystem but as data points to be optimized in a high-tech urban landscape.","[99, 16]",888295
